EV3.14
======

A modified firmware for the Lego EV3 that allows it to be driven by a RaspberryPi

To use this project, you may either do a dd copy of the filesystem onto your SD card or build it from the sources. For further information about the hacking work we did out of the Lego firmware, please visit our wiki : http://icube-avr.unistra.fr/en/index.php/Hacking_the_Lego_EV3.

The usb-communication.c file is an example to show you how to interact with the EV3 through USB protocol.
